# JavaScript To-Do List Web App

## Overview

As a software engineer, I wanted to solidify my understanding of front-end JavaScript by building a functional and responsive to-do list application from scratch. This web-based app demonstrates key concepts like DOM manipulation, array operations, recursion, exception handling, and third-party library integration.

The app allows users to:
- Add, mark complete, and delete tasks
- Clear all tasks recursively
- See styled error messages using Toastify.js
- Persist tasks in memory during the session
